                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort.
                    Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different
                    learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning
                    easier. Make it stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. 
                    Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines,
                    the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. 
                    The instructions call for at least six sentences of text. Here I am adding that 
                    sixth sentence of text.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                   A collection of fun and educational projects designed to entertain programmers
                   while enhancing their Python skills. It picks up where the complete beginner books 
                   leave off, expanding on existing concepts and introducing new tools that you'll
                   use every day. And to keep things interesting, each project includes a zany twist
                    featuring historical incidents, pop culture references, and literary allusions. 
                    The instructions also call for this to be six sentences. Here is the fifth sentence. 
                    The sixth sentence will complete the paragraph.
