                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort.
                    Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different
                    learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning
                    easier. Make it stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. 
                    Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines,
                    the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. 
                    The instructions call for at least six sentences of text. Here I am adding that 
                    sixth sentence of text.

                <h2>My review</h2>

                    <p>
                        This review will contain my opinion about the book. I personally thought
                        this book was fantastic. The content was interesting and kept me engaged. 
                        However, I did not enjoy the personal stories the author included. This 
                        caused me to drop one star. I think the ideas presented were enough content 
                        and the stories distracted from it. I would however still recommend this book.

                        I had a friend also read this book. They provided me with their review, which 
                        also was comparable to my own. They thought the content was informative. The 
                        visual aspect of the book was appealing. My friend would also recommend this book 
                        to a friend who is interested. They gave the book 4 stars as well.
